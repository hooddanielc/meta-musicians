Subject: [PATCH] Workaround build errors on musl libc
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Currently musl does not support GLOB_TILDE but it is on their roadmap [1]. This
patch is no fix and changes functionality for musl. A slightly changed
functionality seems better than being unable to build.

For glibc and future versions of musl this change is a noop.

Upstream-Status: Submitted [2]
